currently not using, only 256 units can be dispensed using cash_bytes.
To support more, transaction should start by updating cpml by a factor. 
For example if you want 1000 units, cpml *= 10 and 100 cash_bytes would be good.

Attacker can finish the transaction by getting product_key and not using it. 
After user starts transaction, Attacker can use the product_key to finish the transaction.
So try to fix it or detect Attacker.
